## 1) Context
Short summary (1–3 lines):  
Theory room about **planning and running a red team engagement**: defining objectives and scope, writing Rules of Engagement (RoE), and building layered documentation (Engagement / Ops / Mission / Remediation plans) for realistic, controlled campaigns.

## 2) Initial hypothesis
What I expected before starting:  
- Understand the main **components and functions** of a red team engagement.  
- Learn how to properly **plan an engagement** based on needs, resources, and TTPs.  
- Understand how to **write and structure engagement documentation** aligned with client objectives.

## 3) Tools used
Short list — **do not** include options, credentials, or sensitive scripts.  
- Planning & documentation frameworks (CONOPS, RoE, kill chains).  
- Threat modelling / TTP frameworks (e.g., ATT&CK, APT profiles).  
- Collaboration & comms tools (mail, chat, documentation platforms).  
- (Room was **theoretical**: no offensive tooling executed.)

## 4) Approach (high level)
Conceptual steps followed:  
- Study how **objectives and scope** drive everything: what is tested, how, and what “success” means.  
- Break the engagement into **document layers**: RoE → Engagement Plan → Operations Plan → Mission Plan → Remediation Plan.  
- Map client goals to **engagement types** (tabletop, adversary emulation, physical, assumed breach, etc.).  
- Review typical **RoE sections** (executive summary, scope, ground rules, authority, POCs, approvals).  
- Translate high-level intent (CONOPS) into concrete resource, operations, and mission plans operators can actually execute.

## 5) Results / Evidence (sanitized)
What I observed (impact, sanitized):  
- Clear understanding that **objectives + scope** are the foundation: they feed RoE, drive constraints, and define what is “in play”.  
- RoE is a **legal and contractual** backbone: expectations, responsibilities, restrictions, and stop conditions are explicit.  
- Campaign planning naturally splits into four plans:  
  - **Engagement Plan:** CONOPS + resource view (strategic).  
  - **Operations Plan:** personnel, stopping conditions, TTPs, comms (operational).  
  - **Mission Plan:** tasks, operators, targets, timings, variations (tactical).  
  - **Remediation Plan:** reporting & improvement work after the engagement.  
- Different engagement formats (tabletop, adversary emulation, physical) can reuse the same planning logic, just with different depth and risk profiles.

## 6) Recommended remediation
Generic process/technical measures for real-world use:  
- Always start with **crystal-clear objectives and scope**, agreed and signed off by business stakeholders and the white cell.  
- Maintain a **formal RoE** with: ground rules, restrictions, authorities, stop conditions, and contacts; keep a signed copy before any activity.  
- Use **standardized templates** (CONOPS, Resource, Ops, Mission) so new campaigns are consistent and auditable.  
- Explicitly define **stopping/halting conditions** (service instability, life-safety, critical incident) to avoid overstepping or causing outages.  
- Include a **Remediation Plan** phase by default: findings should translate into concrete actions, workshops, and follow-up testing.

## 7) Lessons learned
- Red team planning is layered: **RoE → Engagement Plan → Ops Plan → Mission Plan → Remediation**, each with a different audience and level of detail.  
- **Objectives and scope drive everything** – tooling, TTPs, timelines, and even what “success” means must be anchored to those.  
- The **CONOPS** is basically a business-friendly story of the engagement: who, why, roughly how, and when – without going into payloads or commands.  
- The **Resource Plan** keeps things realistic: people, time, infra, and knowledge required are explicitly stated – no “magic” extra resources mid-engagement.  
- The **Ops Plan** is where you define stopping conditions, comms, and high-level TTPs so operators don’t improvise outside RoE when things get messy.  
- The **Mission Plan** is the operator’s playbook: objectives, targets, tools, and fallback paths, written so another red teamer could pick it up and execute.
