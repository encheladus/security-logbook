# Principles of Security — TryHackMe
**Date:** 2025-09-18  
**Type:** Classroom  
**Statut:** Done

## 1) Contexte
TryHackMe class regarding the importance of data security in an organization and how to secure it.

## 2) Hypothèse de départ
I expected to better understand security principles around organisational data and how to scale protections to secure it effectively.

## 3) Outils utilisés
A learning/classroom session — no direct tooling used. Concepts and frameworks covered.

## 4) Approche (haut niveau)
Study the core concepts (CIA triad), privilege models (PIM/PAM), classical security models (Bell-LaPadula, Biba), threat modelling (STRIDE, PASTA) and incident response lifecycle. Extract practical lessons applicable to pentest audits and organisational security posture.

## 5) Résultats / preuve (sanitisé)
- Core concepts consolidated: CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
- Privilege management clarified: PIM (map roles → access), PAM (manage those privileged accesses).
- Models compared:
  - Bell-LaPadula: **confidentiality-focused** — *no write down, no read up*.
  - Biba: **integrity-focused** — *no write up, no read down*.
- Threat modelling (STRIDE) and IR lifecycle summarized.
- Evidence: summarized notes and conceptual mappings (no sensitive data).

## 6) Remédiation recommandée
- Apply principle of least privilege (PIM → PAM workflows).
- Implement role-based access controls with review/rotation for privileged accounts.
- Use threat modelling (STRIDE) during design phases to bake in mitigations.
- Maintain an IR plan aligned with NIST/ISO best practices: preparation → identification → containment → eradication → recovery → lessons learned.
- Ensure availability via redundancy, DR/BCP and DDoS mitigations as part of holistic CIA balancing.

## 7) Leçons apprises
- Understand data value first — design controls according to confidentiality, integrity and availability needs.
- Historical context matters: early models target different priorities (military vs business).
- Security is process-driven (models + testing + IR), not only tooling.
- Threat modelling and formal IR procedures are essential operational complements to access models.
- For pentesting: framing tests around CIA + STRIDE yields a clearer impact analysis.
