## 1) Context
Short summary (1–3 lines):  
Theory room on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and how to apply it to **red team engagements** and **adversary emulation**. Focus on using TTPs, IOCs, and frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, kill chains, TIBER-EU) to design realistic, threat-intel-driven campaigns.

## 2) Initial hypothesis
What you expected before starting:  
- Understand the basics of threat intelligence and its use in red team engagements.  
- Learn how to create a **threat-intel-driven campaign**.  
- Use frameworks to structure concepts and leverage CTI (ATT&CK, kill chains, TIBER-EU).

## 3) Tools used
Short list — **do not** include options, credentials, or sensitive scripts.  
- CTI reports / ISAC feeds (TTPs, IOCs).  
- MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise) and Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain.  
- TIBER-EU documentation (conceptual).  
- Threat intel / actor-mapping platforms (conceptual: OST Map, vendor TI portals).  

## 4) Approach (high level)
Conceptual steps followed (no precise commands):  
- Clarify what **CTI** is (IOCs + TTPs, ISACs, TI platforms) and how blue vs red teams consume it.  
- Study **TIBER-EU** as a framework where TI drives planning and testing for financial/critical entities.  
- Practice **TTP mapping**: pick an actor → extract their techniques → map to a kill chain / ATT&CK phases.  
- See how CTI informs **C2 profiles and tooling behavior** (headers, URIs, user agents, timing) for realistic emulation.  
- Build a **threat-intel-driven campaign skeleton**: framework choice, actor selection, TTP extraction, mapping, documentation, and resources.

## 5) Results / Evidence (sanitized)
What you observed (impact, non-sensitive):  
- CTI for red teaming is used mainly in **planning**: selecting actors, shaping goals, and defining realistic TTPs per phase.  
- TIBER-EU positions TI as **central**, not optional: Testing phase is explicitly TI-based ethical red teaming.  
- Practical mental model emerged:  
  - ATT&CK = **dictionary** of techniques.  
  - CTI reports = **story** of how actors use them.  
  - Kill chain = **timeline** to place them in.  
- Saw how **C2 and malware behaviors** (URIs, headers, UA, beacon tempo, LOLBAS use) can be adapted from CTI to increase fidelity and to test whether blue teams actually operationalize their own threat intel.

## 6) Recommended remediation
Generic, TI-related measures for real engagements:  
- Always **start with the client context**: choose actors and TTPs that match their sector, geography, and risk profile.  
- Define an explicit **fidelity level** for emulation (how close to the real actor you need to be) to avoid over-engineering.  
- Use **TTP mapping tables** (Kill Chain ↔ ATT&CK ↔ Emulation) so campaigns remain traceable and defensible.  
- Reuse and maintain **C2 profiles, actor sheets, mapping templates** to turn CTI into repeatable operational artifacts.  
- Align red-team outputs with blue-team CTI workflows: ensure findings include **TTPs, ATT&CK IDs, and detection ideas**, not just IOCs.

## 7) Lessons learned
- CTI for red teaming is less about chasing IOCs and more about **stealing the attacker’s playbook**: their tactics, tempo, and habits.  
- The **TIBER-EU view** is useful: threat intelligence belongs at the **core** of realistic red team planning, not as a bolt-on.  
- **TTP Mapping is the glue**: ATT&CK tells me *what* techniques exist, kill chains tell me *where* they fit, and engagement docs define *how* I’ll use them.  
- Emulating **C2 and malware behavior** from CTI (URIs, headers, UAs, timing, LOLBAS) both increases realism and tests whether the blue team uses its own CTI effectively.  
- A threat-intel-driven campaign is basically: **pick actor → extract TTPs → map to framework → wire into CONOPS / Ops / Mission Plans → adjust infra & C2 accordingly.**
