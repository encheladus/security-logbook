**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Type:** Classroom  
**Scope:** Lab / Authorized only

## 1) Context
Short summary (1–3 lines): Explore policies and frameworks vital for regulating cybersecurity in an organisation. Learn how governance, risk management, and compliance frameworks strengthen organisational security posture.

---

## 2) Initial hypothesis
- Understand the role and importance of governance and regulation in cybersecurity.  
- Gain knowledge of international laws, regulations, policies, standards & guidelines.  
- Understand Governance, Risk Management & Compliance (GRC) frameworks.  
- Develop and improve cybersecurity posture according to standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53.

## 3) Tools used
- Not applicable — conceptual / classroom lab

---

## 4) Approach (high level)
- Reviewed key terminology: governance, regulation, compliance.  
- Analysed information security governance, frameworks, and policies.  
- Studied regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GLBA) and their practical implications.  
- Explored ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST 800-53 / 800-63B frameworks.  
- Practised mapping regulations to operational security tasks (policies, procedures, incident response, password policies).  
- Applied GRC concepts to scenario-based exercises to understand integrated risk management.

---

## 5) Results / Evidence (sanitized)
- Successfully mapped multiple frameworks to operational tasks.  
- Developed sample governance documents (password policy, incident response plan).  
- Identified gaps and overlaps between ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST standards.  
- Applied NIST 800-63B for digital identity and authentication controls.  
- Observed that practical implementation requires contextual adaptation and risk-based decision making.

---

## 6) Recommended remediation
- Establish structured governance framework defining roles, responsibilities, and policies.  
- Implement regulatory compliance monitoring mechanisms.  
- Standardise documentation (policies, procedures, baselines, standards).  
- Apply GRC integration to coordinate governance, risk, and compliance activities.  
- Develop and enforce password policies and incident response procedures.  
- Continuously monitor, audit, and improve security posture using frameworks such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST.

---

## 7) Lessons learned
- Governance vs Regulation vs Compliance: governance defines strategy, regulation imposes obligations, compliance ensures adherence.  
- Framework adaptation: combining ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST 800-53 strengthens overall security.  
- GRC integration ensures coordinated risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, and performance measurement.  
- Privacy and data protection require translating legal obligations (GDPR, PCI DSS) into technical and organisational controls.  
- Documentation is essential for operationalising security and passing audits.  
- Incident response and password policies must be standardised and clearly documented.
