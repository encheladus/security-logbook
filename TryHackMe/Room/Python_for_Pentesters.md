# Python for Pentesting — TryHackMe - Python

**Date:** 2025-09-20  
**Type:** TryHackMe  
**Scope:** Lab / Authorized only

---

## 1) Context

This room focuses on using **Python as a core automation and scripting tool in cybersecurity**.  
It demonstrates how Python can be applied to real-world pentesting tasks such as enumeration, scanning, brute forcing, file retrieval, and basic exploitation logic.

---

## 2) Initial hypothesis

Before starting, I expected to use Python to:

- Automate reconnaissance and enumeration tasks
- Reproduce core functionality of common pentesting tools
- Build simple scanners and brute-force logic
- Understand how scripting improves speed, flexibility, and control during engagements

---

## 3) Tools used

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries (networking, hashing, system interaction)
- Third-party libraries for protocol interaction and automation

*(No sensitive scripts, credentials, or payloads included.)*

---

## 4) Approach (high level)

1. Identified repetitive tasks commonly performed during pentests.
2. Broke each task into simple, automatable logic.
3. Used Python to interact directly with network services and protocols.
4. Implemented enumeration techniques using wordlists and response analysis.
5. Built basic scanning and brute-force workflows.
6. Validated results through application or service responses rather than assumptions.

## 5) Results / Evidence (sanitized)

- Successfully automated subdomain and directory discovery.
- Identified live hosts on a network through active probing.
- Detected open TCP ports on target systems.
- Retrieved remote files programmatically.
- Matched hashed values against wordlists to recover cleartext values.
- Simulated credential brute-force logic against network services.

**Final state:** multiple pentesting workflows automated using lightweight, purpose-built Python scripts.

---

## 6) Recommended remediation

- Monitor and rate-limit authentication and brute-force attempts.
- Disable unnecessary services and close unused ports.
- Use strong, salted, slow hashing algorithms for password storage.
- Detect abnormal scanning or enumeration behaviour.
- Apply least-privilege principles and proper network segmentation.

---

## 7) Lessons learned

- Python is a **force multiplier** in offensive security.
- Many pentesting tools are simple logic wrapped in automation.
- Understanding how tools work internally improves adaptability.
- Custom scripts can be quieter and more flexible than large frameworks.
- Automation reduces human error during long engagements.
