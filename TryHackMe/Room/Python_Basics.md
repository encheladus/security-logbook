# Python Basics for Pentesters — TryHackMe

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Type:** TryHackMe  
**Scope:** Classroom / Authorized only

---

## 1) Context

Introductory TryHackMe classroom focused on Python fundamentals for security practitioners.  
Goal: understand core programming concepts and apply them toward simple automation and tooling relevant to pentesting.

---

## 2) Initial hypothesis

The room would introduce the foundations of Python needed for security work, including:
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (conditions and loops)
- Functions and modular code
- Basic file handling
- Core logic needed for automation

---

## 3) Tools used

- Python (standard interpreter)
- Built-in libraries only

---

## 4) Approach (high level)

- Learned Python syntax and core concepts incrementally
- Practiced each concept immediately with small examples
- Used output statements to observe program flow
- Progressively combined concepts through guided exercises
- Refactored inline logic into functions for clarity and reuse

---

## 5) Results / Evidence (sanitized)

- Successfully completed all classroom exercises
- Built simple scripts using variables, conditions, loops, and functions
- Read from and wrote to files correctly using appropriate modes
- Demonstrated correct use of Boolean logic and control flow
- Final state: functional Python scripts aligned with automation use cases

---

## 6) Recommended remediation

*(Learning-focused lab — no vulnerability remediation required)*

General best practices reinforced:
- Clear code structure using functions
- Consistent indentation and scope awareness
- Explicit handling of file modes and resources
- Readable logic over overly compact expressions

---

## 7) Lessons learned

- Python syntax is simple, but logic and structure are critical
- Boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`) is central to decision-making
- Loops and conditionals form the backbone of automation
- Functions greatly improve readability and maintainability
- File I/O is essential for real-world security scripting
- Python’s readability makes scripts easier to audit and extend
