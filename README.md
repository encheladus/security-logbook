# 🚀 Pentest Journey — From 0 to Pentester

Hi, I’m Nicolas — currently a Senior Product Owner (PMO-ready) in the luxury industry, 
and on a parallel track I’m building expertise in offensive security (pentesting, bug bounty).  

This repository is my **public logbook** of technical progress: challenges solved, notes, 
and write-ups. My goal is to reach a professional level in red teaming and bug bounty 
within the next 2–3 years.  

## 📂 Structure
- `tryhackme/` → notes & write-ups from TryHackMe challenges
- `hackthebox/` → HTB machines and learnings
- `notes/` → theory & cheatsheets (SQLi, XSS, etc.)

## 🌐 More detailed version
I keep a **full detailed logbook** (screenshots, step-by-step, personal notes) here:
